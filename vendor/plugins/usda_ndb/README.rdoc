= usda_ndb

Rake tasks and ActiveRecord models for managing the USDA Nutrient Database.

Packaged as a separate database w/ namespaced models.

Notes:
* a lot of the rake tasks are rough around the edges, but they should help in getting the nutrient database where you need it to be.
* only the abbreviated data is currently supported, although all data will be dumped into the database. Support for this data is forthcoming

Todo (related to the above):
* make rake tasks for inside a project's directory
* support whole ndb database

== Usage

<pre>
# loads data.yml into database defined in usda_ndb.yml (use from usda_ndb gem directory)
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:data:load 

# in your code
UsdaNdb::AbbreviatedData.find(10000) # looks up by the NDB No
</pre>

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
